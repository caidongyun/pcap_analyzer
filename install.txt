Requirements to run pcap_analyzer.pl correctly:

Perl v 5.20 or higher (not tested on Perl 6)

CPAN modules:

Net::TcpDumpLog
NetPacket::Ethernet
NetPacket::IP
NetPacket::TCP
NetPacket::UDP
NetPacket::ICMP

In order to install the modules please run the command (with root privileges):

cpan -i use Net::TcpDumpLog NetPacket::Ethernet NetPacket::IP NetPacket::TCP NetPacket::UDP NetPacket::ICMP;

The "install.sh" script, installs the modules by just running it with either sudo or a privileged user.


NOTE: On the last day of development of this tool (Jan 4th 2017), I discovered
a bug on the NetPacket::ICMP module where is not able to extract ICMP data correctly
due to 4 unused bytes (missing perhaps of the nature, however the RFC states these are mandatory)
between the ICMP headers and the data, hence the decoding of the information is not performed correctly.

In order to fix this issue, an extra 'N' value was added to the unpack method of ICMP
module (line 140 of the original module) to capture 4 bytes of data and stored on the
temporary "$self->{padding}" object:

($self->{type}, $self->{code}, $self->{cksum}, $self->{padding}, $self->{data}) =
    unpack("CCnNa*", $pkt);
  }

The original values are:

($self->{type}, $self->{code}, $self->{cksum}, $self->{data}) =
    unpack("CCna*", $pkt);
  }

I have submitted a fix for this issue, however it has not been fixed so far, thus I'm adding
a local copy of the module within the NetPacket folder where the patched ICMP.pm file
is contained, though the installation of the original module is performed.

The purpose of this is to remove the local folder when the original module is fixed.
